# SpellBookUnlock
Addon for Iron's Spells 'n Spellbooks that allows the user to lock and unlock spell books.
This mod is an addon to Iron's Spells 'n Spellbooks. I made this mod because having certain spells locked into higher ranked spell books became frustrating. The mod allows users at a (default) level of 32 to lock/unlock spellbooks for a (default) cost of 12 levels. To use the mod simply hold the spell book you want to lock/unlock in your main hand and sneak+U. As of now it is only for Forge 1.20.1 and only the level requirements and costs can be changed in the config
